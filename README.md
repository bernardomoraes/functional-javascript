# Functional Javascript Course

This repository has intended to contain all my notions and codes related to the course Functional Javascript by Cod3r.

By the end of the course I pretend to know how to build projects with functionall programming.

If you have something to contribute, please open an issue on this repository. I'm open to listen and learn even more.
